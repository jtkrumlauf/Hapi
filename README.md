# About
Our goal when creating Hapi was to provide companies with a way to develop a deeper understanding of public perception relating to their products or brand. Hapi collects the following information about a user or hashtags last 100 tweets:
* Average Sentiment
* Most Positive Tweet
* Most Negative Tweet
* Number of Positive Tweets
* Number of Negative Tweets
* Number of Neutral Tweets
* Number of Tweets Omitted

_*Note: Tweets omitted are tweets that only contain a link, image, media, or are in a different language*_

# Development Roadmap
We plan to continue developing Hapi. Here are a few things we are working on to improve the site:
* Efficiency
* User Experience and Interactability
